## Phase 1: Foundation Building (4-6 Weeks)

- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):**
    - **Core Concepts:**
        - **Arrays & Strings:**
            - Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, String Manipulation
            - Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks
        - **Linked Lists:**
            - Singly, Doubly, Circular Linked Lists
            - Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, Grokking the Coding Interview
        - **Trees:**
            - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Tree Traversals
            - Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, Grokking the Coding Interview
        - **Graphs:**
            - Graph Representation, Graph Traversal Algorithms (DFS, BFS)
            - Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, Grokking the Coding Interview
        - **Sorting & Searching:**
            - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick Sort)
            - Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)
            - Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, Grokking the Coding Interview
        - **Dynamic Programming:**
            - Recursion, Memoization, Tabulation
            - Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, Dynamic Programming by Erik Demaine & Shmoys
    - **Practice:**
        - Daily coding challenges on LeetCode/HackerRank (aim for 1-2 problems per day)
        - Focus on understanding time and space complexity analysis.
- **Programming Language:**
    - **Choose one and master it:** Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript
    - **Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.**
    - **Focus on language-specific features and libraries.**
